# MERN BOOKSHOP

This is a bookshop type application using [MERN](https://mern.io) stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).  The application makes use of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for a single source of truth with state.  Users are able to upload books to the database being hosted by mLabs allowing for a persistent collection of books.
